# node-webkit-starter
A grunt based node-webkit starter with build option

## Requirement
Naturally, this requires that you have a version of Node installed, and grunt-cli available.




## Installation
<br/>
Simply run `npm install` to install dependencies.
<br/>


## Package
<br/>
Running `grunt` will generate build versions. Build option are set on `gruntfile.js` file
<br/>


## Windows specificity
<br/>
There are some `.dll` and `.pack` extra files with the generated executable file for windows platform.
You can improve the result with a simple and alone `.exe` file that encapsulate all the stuff by following steps [here](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/How-to-package-and-distribute-your-apps).
